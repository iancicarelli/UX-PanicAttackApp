### Problem

### Description

The purpose of this project is to be an educational and application instance of user experience design learning.

The problem to be solved is the lack of support tools regarding panic and/or anxiety attacks. Since this project corresponds exclusively to user experience design and its elements, this document describes the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. All of the above is focused on a mobile application to monitor and track panic attacks and how to effectively address them.

### Strategy 
The first step undertaken by the team is to articulate the strategy. A "Value Proposition Canvas" is used as a way to compare our application and the potential solution to the customer's need.

### Scope 
Scope refers to the boundaries of a project, i.e. everything that will be included or excluded in terms of objectives, tasks, and deliverables. It defines the borders of the project and helps maintain focus. After establishing a product strategy, it is critical to define the scope. At this stage, we create a profile of our ideal customer and visualize how our product will work for them.
#### UX Persona
MindEase is an app designed to support users experiencing panic and/or anxiety attacks., providing helpful tools to calm them down, keep track of their episodes, send a message to their trusted contacts, and receive messages of support. MindEase is ideal for those looking to more effectively manage their anxiety attacks, offering an accessible and personalized approach to their emotional well-being. By offering functionalities that help reduce anxiety and connect with a support network, the app has a positive impact on the lives of its users.

As for UX Personas, we created profiles of potential users who would benefit from MindEase, focusing on individuals who suffer from panic and/or anxiety attacks., as well as those looking for an emotional support system during these difficult times.

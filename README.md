### Problem
The core problem of this project lies in the lack of specific and accessible support tools for people who suffer from panic and/or anxiety attacks. Currently, many people do not have immediate resources to help them manage their crises effectively, which can aggravate their situation and generate a feeling of helplessness. Although certain mental health resources exist, they are not always sufficient or designed to respond in real time to the needs of users during a panic episode. The absence of a specialized tool that allows people to monitor, understand and manage their anxiety attacks effectively is a significant barrier on the path to better control of their emotional well-being.

### Description

This project focuses on providing immediate and effective support to people experiencing panic or anxiety attacks, through tools designed to help them manage these episodes safely and calmly. The application not only offers solutions in times of crisis, but also facilitates ongoing monitoring and the establishment of a support network.

Key features:

+ Guided breathing: It will include guided breathing exercises so that the user can control their breathing and reduce physical symptoms during a panic or anxiety attack.

+ Support messages: It will provide calming and encouraging written messages to help the user mitigate stress during an episode.

+ Instant messaging to support contacts: It will allow automatic and quick messages to be sent to trusted contacts, alerting them that the user is experiencing an attack and needs help.

+ Support contacts section: It will include a section where the user can add and manage their support contacts, facilitating a quick connection with trusted people during critical moments.

+ Attack history: A log will be provided where the user can monitor and track their panic attacks, obtaining details about each episode. This feature will help identify patterns and improve the management of attacks over time.

### Strategy 
The first step undertaken by the team is to articulate the strategy. A "Value Proposition Canvas" is used as a way to compare our application and the potential solution to the customer's need.

### Scope 
Scope refers to the boundaries of a project, i.e. everything that will be included or excluded in terms of objectives, tasks, and deliverables. It defines the borders of the project and helps maintain focus. After establishing a product strategy, it is critical to define the scope. At this stage, we create a profile of our ideal customer and visualize how our product will work for them.
#### UX Persona

#### Benchmark 
In order to develop an application that meets user expectations, it is essential for the team to perform a comparative analysis of existing applications on the market, especially direct competitors. This benchmarking process allows the team to identify both successes and areas for improvement in other products, in order to apply these lessons to their own development.

By studying competing applications, the team can avoid common mistakes and adopt successful features, which helps create a more robust solution aligned with user needs.

#### Customer Journey Map 
The Customer Journey Map is a valuable tool for understanding the user experience in their interaction with MindEase. By mapping each stage in detail, from the first contact with the application to its recurrent use, we can identify the emotions, needs and critical moments that users experience, especially during a panic attack. This analysis allows us to detect challenges and opportunities to improve their experience, helping us to design effective and empathetic solutions. By immersing ourselves in the user's world, we strengthen their bond with MindEase and create an experience that truly accompanies them in the most difficult moments.

### Structure 
The Structure section defines the organization and flow of the application, showing how the different screens and functionalities are connected and navigated. The goal is to ensure fluid and efficient navigation, prioritizing quick access to the essential tools that the user needs at critical moments.

### Skeleton 
Wireframe is a visual schematic that represents the basic structure of an application page or screen. After defining requirements and refining user needs, we begin wireframe design as part of the skeleton blueprint (Chapter 6, User Experience Elements). At this stage, key aspects of the interface, navigation, and layout are identified. From this, a mockup is created to show how the design will communicate with the user and present information. In line with the surface blueprint (Chapter 7, User Experience Elements), wireframes guide the final implementation of the user interface, emphasizing visual design and final presentation. Additionally, wireframes facilitate communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders, allowing for discussion and validation of the design and functionality prior to implementation.

### Surface 
Once the wireframe has been reviewed and approved by the design, development, and stakeholder teams, the next step is to create a more visually detailed interface. In this phase, which corresponds to the Surface Plan (Chapter 7, User Experience Elements), the focus is on the final appearance of the app and how users will interact with it visually. Elements such as color, typography, and contrast are critical to creating an engaging and coherent experience.

Mockups are used at this stage to offer a more accurate representation of the interface, integrating not only the structure and functionality, but also the visual aspects that will influence how users perceive and navigate the product. The goal is for the final design to not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also communicate the brand identity and guide users effectively.

Initially, a single color, green, was used to represent the application as a whole. Additionally, the buttons were flat, and the templates were simple. However, it was decided to opt for buttons in different pastel shades that personalize the design entirely. Thanks to these changes, the application is now much more diverse and visually appealing, offering users a personalized and unique experience.

Adding to this is the involvement of Billy, a character that represents calm and will assist each user during their panic or anxiety attacks. Billy not only provides users with support tools but also effectively reinforces the identity of the application.

On the other hand, the choice of button size was an essential aspect when visualizing the application, as it took into account the user's perspective. If someone were in that situation, would they really have the ability to click shakily on the correct buttons? Because of this, what would be ideal: to make buttons small or large? Should they be swipeable or not? And if they are swipeable, should there be instructions regarding this? Without the intention of overwhelming with unnecessary information, but with the appropriate commands, the application adapted increasingly to the needs of the analyzed users.

### Heuristics and Feedback Implementations

In this update, several key changes were implemented to improve the user experience (UX) of the application. These modifications were informed by usability principles and collaborators feedback, aiming to improve the intuitiveness, accessibility, and overall functionality of the app. Below is a detailed summary of the changes:

### Problem

### Description

The purpose of this project is to be an educational and application instance of user experience design learning.

The problem to be solved is the lack of support tools regarding panic and/or anxiety attacks. Since this project corresponds exclusively to user experience design and its elements, this document describes the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. All of the above is focused on a mobile application to monitor and track panic attacks and how to effectively address them.

### Strategy 
The first step undertaken by the team is to articulate the strategy. A "Value Proposition Canvas" is used as a way to compare our application and the potential solution to the customer's need.

### Scope 
Scope refers to the boundaries of a project, i.e. everything that will be included or excluded in terms of objectives, tasks, and deliverables. It defines the borders of the project and helps maintain focus. After establishing a product strategy, it is critical to define the scope. At this stage, we create a profile of our ideal customer and visualize how our product will work for them.
#### UX Persona
MindEase is an app designed to support users experiencing panic and/or anxiety attacks., providing helpful tools to calm them down, keep track of their episodes, send a message to their trusted contacts, and receive messages of support. MindEase is ideal for those looking to more effectively manage their anxiety attacks, offering an accessible and personalized approach to their emotional well-being. By offering functionalities that help reduce anxiety and connect with a support network, the app has a positive impact on the lives of its users.

As for UX Personas, we created profiles of potential users who would benefit from MindEase, focusing on individuals who suffer from panic and/or anxiety attacks., as well as those looking for an emotional support system during these difficult times.

#### Benchmark 

#### Customer Journey Map 
The Customer Journey Map is a valuable tool for understanding the user experience in their interaction with MindEase. By mapping each stage in detail, from the first contact with the application to its recurrent use, we can identify the emotions, needs and critical moments that users experience, especially during a panic attack. This analysis allows us to detect challenges and opportunities to improve their experience, helping us to design effective and empathetic solutions. By immersing ourselves in the user's world, we strengthen their bond with MindEase and create an experience that truly accompanies them in the most difficult moments.

### Structure

### Skeleton 
Wireframe is a visual schematic that represents the basic structure of an application page or screen. After defining requirements and refining user needs, we begin wireframe design as part of the skeleton blueprint (Chapter 6, User Experience Elements). At this stage, key aspects of the interface, navigation, and layout are identified. From this, a mockup is created to show how the design will communicate with the user and present information. In line with the surface blueprint (Chapter 7, User Experience Elements), wireframes guide the final implementation of the user interface, emphasizing visual design and final presentation. Additionally, wireframes facilitate communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders, allowing for discussion and validation of the design and functionality prior to implementation.

### Surface 
Once the wireframe has been reviewed and approved by the design, development, and stakeholder teams, the next step is to create a more visually detailed interface. In this phase, which corresponds to the Surface Plan (Chapter 7, User Experience Elements), the focus is on the final appearance of the app and how users will interact with it visually. Elements such as color, typography, and contrast are critical to creating an engaging and coherent experience.

Mockups are used at this stage to offer a more accurate representation of the interface, integrating not only the structure and functionality, but also the visual aspects that will influence how users perceive and navigate the product. The goal is for the final design to not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also communicate the brand identity and guide users effectively.
